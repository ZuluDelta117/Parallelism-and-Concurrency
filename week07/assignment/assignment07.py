'''
Requirements
1.  Create a multiprocessing program that connects the processes using Pipes.
2.  Create a process from each of the following custom process classes, 
    Marble_Creator, Bagger, Assembler, and Wrapper.
3.  The Marble_Creator process will send a marble to the Bagger process using
    a Pipe.
4.  The Bagger process will create a Bag object with the required number of
    marbles. 
5.  The Bagger process will send the Bag object to the Assembler using a Pipe.
6.  The Assembler process will create a Gift object and send it to the Wrapper
    process using a Pipe.
7.  The Wrapper process will write to a file the current time followed by the 
    gift string.
8.  The program should not hard-code the number of marbles, the various delays,
    nor the bag count. These should be obtained from the settings.txt file.

Questions:
1.  Why can you not use the same pipe object for all the processes (i.e., why 
    do you need to create three different pipes)?
    >Because a pipe can only have one start location and one end location.
    >If you tried to use one pipe the data would get all mixed up and I think you would deadlock.
2.  Compare and contrast pipes with queues (i.e., how are the similar or different)?
    >Queues are able to send and recieve to multiple location where pipes cannot.
    >They are both used to send and recieve data though. I think pipes are faster and
    >more simple to use when doing things that are a step by step process and each 
    >piece of data builds on top of each other.
